## 🌟 Overview
The **Virtual Dressing Room** is an AI-powered web application that allows users to virtually try on clothes before making a purchase. The system uses **Python's PIL (Pillow) library** for image processing, enabling seamless overlay of selected clothing onto the user's uploaded image.
