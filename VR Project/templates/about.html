    <h2>Our Virtual Dressing Room</h2>
    <p>
        The Virtual Dressing Room is an innovative project designed to enhance the online shopping experience by allowing users to virtually try on clothing and accessories. This project leverages the power of Python Imaging Library (PIL) along with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an interactive platform that simulates the dressing experience.
    </p>
    <p>
        Our goal was to provide a solution that not only simplifies the shopping process but also increases user engagement by enabling customers to visualize how products will look on them before making a purchase.

    <h2>Technologies Used</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Python</strong>: The backend of our application is powered by Python, which handles data processing and server-side logic.</li>
        <li><strong>Flask</strong>: We utilized Flask as our web framework to facilitate the development of our web application.</li>
        <li><strong>PIL</strong>: The Python Imaging Library (PIL) enables us to manipulate images effectively, allowing users to see how different garments fit on them.</li>
        <li><strong>HTML/CSS</strong>: These technologies were employed to create the structure and style of our web pages, ensuring a responsive and user-friendly interface.</li>
        <li><strong>JavaScript</strong>: JavaScript enhances the interactivity of our web application, providing a seamless user experience.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Future Implementations</h2>
    <p>
        We are continuously working on improving our Virtual Dressing Room. One of the exciting future implementations involves the integration of machine learning models to achieve higher accuracy in virtual fitting. By using advanced algorithms, we aim to provide personalized recommendations and better fit simulations based on user measurements and preferences.
